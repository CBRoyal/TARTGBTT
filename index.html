                <p>Now land traveling might be easy if you just need to travel on foot or
                   via taxi to your next Race location, but if it involves complex bus and train 
                   traveling to your next faraway Race location, you need to be able to book your 
                   bus or train tickets in-and-out properly.To be able to do that, you first need 
                   to find the ticketing window and ask for the quickest and earliest bus or train 
                   ride to your next Race destination.</p>

                   your current Race destination to your next Race destination, you'll be given
                   tickets for a reserved bus or train departure made by The Amazing Race crew.

            <p>Air traveling is the most important aspect of The Amazing Race. In almost every
